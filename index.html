					<h4>Project Description:</h4>
					&emsp;&emsp;My first experience with programming in Unity.  I joined the project about a 6 months into its development
					and began to work on small sections like character movement.  After a while I was moved up to designing and 
					implementing minigames.  By the end of the project, I had made one of the minigames and helped on another that would be 
					present in the final product.

					<h4>Project Description:</h4>
					&emsp;&emsp;This project was started and completed for my Senior Capstone in Spring 2018.  The goal of the project was
					to produce a site for an external client.  Our, Mr. Bill Adams, wanted a site that could easily connect pro-bono 
					lawyers to those who would not normally be in a position to afford such help.  Over the course of the semester, 9 
					other class members and I combined our skills into satisfying his desires for the future site.

					<h4>Project Description:</h4>
					&emsp;&emsp;A small personal project aimed at refamiliarizing myself with Unity for an upcoming class.  The concept 
					was a game where the player has to navigate a maze and find the exit.  The catch of the game is that the player is 
					'blind' and has to find the way across the play area without hitting the void or a hazard.  Additionally, they have 
					a limited of pings (a way to see what is in the immediate area around them) to navigate.  The project was intended 
					for a mobile device.
