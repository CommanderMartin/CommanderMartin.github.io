							&emsp;&emsp;A post-graduation project aimed at developing a voxel based building game.  While nowhere near being complete, the 
							current version of the project allows the player to build guns, magazines, gun ammo, and structures to their liking.  The gun 
							system allows the player to build guns that have different stastics (ammo caliber, dispersion, fire rate), while the ammo
							system enables the player to build types of ammo that have different effects (armor penetration, damage, speed).  I plan to 
							return to this project after SEIGE 2018 has concluded.

							&emsp;&emsp;A small project designed and partially completed for one of the game design and development classes I took duing late 2017.
							During the Fall 2017 semester, I worked with another student in the class to develop the project.  We decided upon a horror game based inside
							a 1980s arcade.  The player becomes trapped and has to defeat minigames to eventually make their escape.  Due to the constraints of the class
							and the personal limits on the time we could put into the project, it was not fully completed.  After completing my degree at MGSU, I 
							returned to the project to finish it.

							<h4>Project Information:</h4>
							&emsp;&emsp;This project came out of the class immediately after the one that Lost Souls' Arcade was created in.  Instead of taking 
							place in a confined area, this one was set to be semi-open world where the player would advance through different levels as they
							completed objectives.  The game was intended to be a sort of '3D Oregon Trail' where the player would go on a journey with 3 other
							NPCs and a wagon.  
							
							<br><br>						
							&emsp;&emsp;The player set as the party leader and with the job to get not only themselves but also as many of their NPCs as
							possible to the end of the journey.  The game was planned to have 11 levels, each one harder than the previous.  The player would 
							be incentivised to prepare for the later stages as early as possible.  The game is currently unfinished with only 2 of the 11 
							stages complete, and only some core mechanics with partial implementation.

							The concept of the game is that the player has to navigate a maze and find the exit.  A normally simple task, but

							immediate area around them). The project was intended for a mobile device.
