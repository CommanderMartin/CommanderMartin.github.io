						<h3> Tesla's Revenge </h3>
					
						Active Work Dates : Fall 2015 - Spring 2017

						Role(s): Programmer
						<br>
						Languages Used: C# (Unity Engine)
						
						<br>
						<h4>Project Description:</h4>
						&emsp;&emsp;My first experience with programming in Unity.  I joined the project about a 6 months into its development
						and began to work on small sections like character movement.  At the time, the team was having problems with the 
						player character phasing through the walls and other objects with 2D BoxCollider components.  I was able to devise a 
						system of raycasts that prevented this problem from occuring.
						<br><br>
						&emsp;&emsp;Immediately after completing this problem, I was given the ability to make a minigame that would go into 
						the main project.  This minigame took about two to three weeks to go from idea to actualized game.  After helping with 
						some other miscellaneous parts of the project, I was again assigned another minigame to work on.  It was more
						complicated than the last one, but it took only slightly longer to complete, about 3 weeks.  I must not that in both
						of these minigames I only worked on the programming and design aspects.  I was aided in the art department by another
						member of the team.

						&emsp;&emsp;This project was started and completed for my Senior Capstone in Spring 2018.  Our group of 
						10 students, including myself, were instructed to make a functional website for client Bill Adams.  We 
						gathered all of Mr. Adams requirements and set to designing a site to fit his needs.  During the 
						initial phases, we dove into color theory, page layout optimization, and multiple

						&emsp;&emsp;Over the course of the semester, we met with him and his colleagues multiple times.  
						At each of these meetings, they were impressed with the work that we had performed and only had requests for minor additions
						to the site.

						<h3> Ping </h3>
						
						Active Work Dates : Summer 2017

						Role(s): Game Designer, Programmer
						<br>
						Languages Used: C# (Unity Engine)
						
						<br><br>
						&emsp;&emsp;A small personal project aimed at refamiliarizing myself with Unity for an upcoming class at the time.  
						The concept of the game is that the player has to navigate a maze and find the exit.  A normally simple task, but
						unfortunately the player is 'blind' and must find the way using sound pings (a way to see what is in the 
						immediate area around them). The project was intended for a mobile device though the appropriate touch controls
						were not implemented.
