									<h4>Project Information:</h4>									
									&emsp;&emsp;A small project in which I challenged myself to create a game in 24 hours.  I developed all object models, 
									scripts, and story components within this timeframe.  
									<br><br>
									&emsp;&emsp;The game's core idea is that of isolation.  The player is stuck in an enclosed space and must discover the story of the
									character they play as while looking for clues on how disarm the self-destruct system every day.  Along the way, they
									can find notes on some of the player's history and the lore of the world.
									<br><br>
									&emsp;&emsp;The ultimate plan for the game was to have the player solve puzzles and escape their confinement.  At the current stage
									of the game, only the first stage, where the player escapes the initial room only to find another, is complete.  The second and
									third stages are intended to build on the puzzles and systems presented in the previous thus gradually increasing the difficulty
									as the game progresses.

										<h4>Project Information:</h4>
										&emsp;&emsp;A post-graduation project aimed at developing a voxel based building game.  While nowhere near being complete, the 
										current version of the project allows the player to build guns, magazines, gun ammo, and structures to their liking.  The gun 
										system allows the player to build guns that have different stastics (ammo caliber, dispersion, fire rate), while the ammo
										system enables the player to build types of ammo that have different effects (armor penetration, damage, speed).  I plan to 
										return to this project after SEIGE 2018 has concluded.
										
										<br><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Upon returning to this project, my current plans are, at the very least, to create a system that allows players to 
										build vehicles in the same manner as guns and to finish out the structure building system.  It is a distant hope that I am
										able to continue the game onto a sellable release version.

									<h4>Project Information:</h4>
									&emsp;&emsp;A small project designed and partially completed for one of the game design and development classes I took duing late 2017.
									During the Fall 2017 semester, I worked with another student in the class to develop the project.  We decided upon a horror game based inside
									a 1980s arcade.  The player becomes trapped and has to defeat minigames to eventually make their escape.  After each minigame, they have to
									not only find the key to open the door to the next room, but do so while being chased by the monster.  In going through the game, they learn
									that an entity has trapped children's souls there and plans to capture more.  It becomes up to the player to put and end to the monster and
									his plans.
									<br><br>
									&emsp;&emsp;Due to the constraints of the class and the personal limits on the time we could put into the project, it was not fully completed 
									for the Fall 2017 semester.  Despite this, our instructor was very pleased with how the project had come along and gave us the 
									maximum score for the project.  After completing my degree, I chose to come back to the project by myself to finish the last pieces needed to
									call it complete.

									<h4>Project Information:</h4>
									&emsp;&emsp;A small personal project aimed at refamiliarizing myself with Unity for an upcoming class at the time.  
									The concept of the game is that the player has to navigate a maze and find the exit.  A normally simple task, but
									unfortunately the player is 'blind' and must find the way using sound pings (a way to see what is in the 
									immediate area around them). The project was intended for a mobile device though the appropriate touch controls
									were not implemented.
									
									&emsp;&emsp;I have recently picked this project up in the hopes of developing it into a full mobile game with the
									help of level designer, Scott Williams.  Currently, Mr. Williams is working on developing levels while I work to
									implement interesting mechanics and further develop  the existing systems to support the game's future.

									<h4>Project Information:</h4>
									&emsp;&emsp;My first experience with programming in Unity.  I joined the project about a 6 months into its development
									and began to work on small sections like character movement.  At the time, the team was having problems with the 
									player character phasing through the walls and other objects with 2D BoxCollider components.  I was able to devise a 
									system of raycasts that prevented this problem from occuring.
									<br><br>
									&emsp;&emsp;Immediately after completing this problem, I was given the ability to make a minigame that would go into 
									the main project.  This minigame took about two to three weeks to go from idea to actualized game.  After helping with 
									some other miscellaneous parts of the project, I was again assigned another minigame to work on.  It was more
									complicated than the last one, but it took only slightly longer to complete, about 3 weeks.  I must not that in both
									of these minigames I only worked on the programming and design aspects.  I was aided in the art department by another
									member of the team.

									<h4>Project Information:</h4>
									&emsp;&emsp;This project came out of the class immediately after the one that Lost Souls' Arcade was created in.  Instead of taking 
									place in a confined area, this one was set to be semi-open world where the player would advance through different levels as they
									completed objectives.  The game was intended to be a sort of '3D Oregon Trail' where the player would go on a journey with 3 other
									NPCs and a wagon.  
									
									<br><br>						
									&emsp;&emsp;The player set as the party leader and with the job to get not only themselves but also as many of their NPCs as
									possible to the end of the journey.  The game was planned to have 11 levels, each one harder than the previous.  The scenery
									in each level would shift from the calm starting plains to the harsh and cold end-game mountains.  The player would be 
									incentivised to prepare for the later stages as early as possible.  Resources would be plentiful at the beginnging of the game
									and the player would have multiple oppertunities to gather them for trading.  This in turn would allow them to get uncraftable
									items to help them in the late game and help their chances to succeed.
									
									<br><br>
									&emsp;&emsp;The game is currently unfinished with only 2 of the 11 intended stages complete.  Some core mechanics such as NPC
									interaction, NPC shops, and basic needs are partially implemented, while others such as foraging, weather effects, and event
									spawning are wholly lacking from the game.  I currently do not know if I will return to the project due to the wide variety of
									systems that would not only need to be created but also re-written, and assets that would need to be reworked to take the 
									project further to the intended goal of sellable game.
